        <h2>The City Changes</h2>
            <p>The city softens at night. Shadows stretch, streetlights hum, and windows glow like quiet beacons.</p>
            
            <p>Reflictions shimmer on rain-slick pavement. The hum of distant traffic becomes a lullaby for those awake.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Cities have their own heartbeat after midnight."</p>

    <section id="People">

        <h2>The People</h2>
        <p>Some move with purpose, others drift without urgency. The city transorms them, and they transform it in return.</p>

        <h3>Wanderers</h3>
        <p>They trace the edges of light and shadow, noticing the details daylight hides.</p>

        <h3>Observations After Midnight:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flickering neon reflected on wet sidewalks</li>
                <li>Steam rising from subway grates</li>
                <li>Quiet windows glowing in high-rise apartments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>each moment is a fragment of the city's nocturnal story- ephemeral, delicate, and luminous.</p>

    <section id="AfterHours">

        <h2>After Hours</h2>
            <p>The night does not hide the city. It reveals layers invisible in daylight. Every shadow, every light, every reflection becomes a story.</p>
            <p>Traffic slows, the air hums with quiet energy. Alleyways whisper of journeys begun and journeys paused. The city is both still and alive.</p>
            <p>When morning returns, it does not erase the night. It layers another narrative on top, but the echoes remain for those who listen.</p>
